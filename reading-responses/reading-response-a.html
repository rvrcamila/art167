    <p><i>There are programmers for everything. They have different cultures, different tribal folklores, that they use to organize their working life.</i></p>
    <p><i>Not bad for six or seven decades—but keep it in perspective. Software may be eating the world, but the world was previously eaten by other things, too: the rise of the telephone system, the spread of electricity, and the absolute domination of the automobile. It’s miraculous that we have mobile phones, but it’s equally miraculous that we can charge them.</i></p>

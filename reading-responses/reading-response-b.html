      <li>Gibb's argument that "the full potency of the graphic symbol is realized in [...] trademarks of brandmarks" is interesting. I wonder if there are other areas that incorporate graphic symbols with far-reaching and comparably complex emotional implications. Is there an argument to be made for the emotional valence of symbols that are intended to be purely functional? </li>
      <li>Do the elements of objects that we maintain in skeumorphs need to be be suggestive of the funtion of the skeumorph? Can they be suggestive of the original object itself without preserving the function of the remaining element itself?</li>

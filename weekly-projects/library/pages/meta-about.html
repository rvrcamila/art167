    <p>Published in 1970.</p>

    <h4>How to navigate this site</h4>
    <p>There are four main ways to navigate this site. One is to
      navigate back and forth through all the scans using the "Previous"
      link at the bottom of each scanned page and clicking on the
      pictures themselves to move forwards. Another is to use the Home
      page by clicking on the title of each scan. They are listed by title,
      but organized by page number, and all link back to Home. Another is to use the thumbnails on
      the Home page as shortcuts to the pages you're interested in. Alternatively,
      you oculd use the Table of Contents (which is a scanned page itself) to
      any pages in one of the chapters listed. Not all chapters have a corresponding
      page. All pages that are accessible through the Table of Contents have
      a hyperlink to it at the top. All pages are at most three links away
      the Home page. Additionally, some pages include additional links to other
      pages based on content similarities.
